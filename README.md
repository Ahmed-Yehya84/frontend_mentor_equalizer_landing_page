Equalizer landing page is a frontend mentor challenge, that i decided to take, in order to improve my css skills. i used BEM to name my components, and followed the bem methodology with regards to the projects file structure. i also used css grid for the header, flexbox for the footer, and practiced my positioning skills to create the main section of the landing page. so far i've just accomplished the desktop version of this landing page, and will be updating my repo to add an adaptive version of this landing page to make it adapt to a tablet screen size and mobile.
